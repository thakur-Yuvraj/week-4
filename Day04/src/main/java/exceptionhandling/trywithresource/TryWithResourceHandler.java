//try-with-resources (Auto-closing Resources)
//ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement:
//Write a Java program that reads the first line of a file named "info.txt" using BufferedReader.
//Use try-with-resources to ensure the file is automatically closed after reading.
//Handle any IOException that may occur.
//Expected Behavior:
//If the file exists, print its first line.
//If the file does not exist, catch IOException and print "Error reading file".

        //Use try-with-resources to ensure the file is automatically closed after reading.
        try (BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))){
            //If the file exists, print its first line.
            String firstLine = bufferedReader.readLine();
            System.out.println(firstLine);

        }
